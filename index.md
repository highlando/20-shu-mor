# The Lecture
## 1 Introduction to LTI Systems

*I will start my short course by introducing the class of Linear Time Invariant
(LTI) systems and the control related system theory for them. Although LTI
systems can be used to model many real life processes, the mathematical theory
for control is very general.*

 * Introduction
 * The state-space representationj and transfer functions
 * Controllability/Observability
 * Realizations
 

## 2 Introduction to Model Reduction

*The second lecture will be on the fundamental motivations and mathematical
notions of model reduction in general and for LTI in particular. This lecture
will provide some illustrative examples for the use and results of model
reduction.*

## 3 Mathematical Basics for System Theory

*In the 3rd lecture, we will introduce the necessary mathematical foundations
from system theory and linear algebra.*

 * Stability
 * Laplace transform
 * Proper systems
 * System norms

## 4 Projection Based Model Reduction

*In the 4th lecture, I will introduce the fundamental model reduction approach
that uses projections and explain several ways to compute these projections.*

## 5 Balanced Truncation

*A mathematical well understood projection method is Balanced Truncation (BT),
which will be introduced in the 5th lecture.*

 * Gramians
 * Balanced Realizations
 * Balanced Truncation

## Lesson 6

The 6th lecture will be devoted to the numerous variants of Balanced Truncation.

## Lesson 7

In lecture 7, we will introduce basic concepts for controller design for LTI
that are similar to and that use the same mathematical concepts as Balanced
Truncation.

## Lesson 8

The 8th lecture will address the approach of LQG-BT which combines the
controller design and the model reduction by Balanced Truncation.

## Lesson 9

The 9th lecture contains a discussion and several examples on how the LTI
related theory can be extended to so called differential-algebraic equations
(DAEs) or descriptor systems.

## Lesson 10

Bringing all together, in the last lecture, we will show and explain recent
results concerning the control of Navier-Stokes equations by means of low-order
controllers.
