# The Lecture

## 1 Introduction to LTI Systems

*I will start my short course by introducing the class of Linear Time Invariant
(LTI) systems and the control related system theory for them. Although LTI
systems can be used to model many real life processes, the mathematical theory
for control is very general.*

 * An illustrative example
 * The state-space representation and transfer functions
 * Controllability/Observability
 * Realizations

## 2 Mathematical Basics of LTI Systems 1

1. Screencast with introduction to math basics and explanations of the 1st exercise
sheet on
  * Hautusz' criteria
  * Equivalence transformations
2. Please download and solve the [1st exercise sheet](exi.pdf).
3. Screencast with the solutions.

## 3 Mathematical Basics of LTI Systems 2

1. Screencast with introduction to math basics and explanations of the 2nd exercise
sheet on
  * Stability and Minimality,
  * System Norms.
2. Please download and solve the [2nd exercise sheet](exii.pdf).
3. Screencast with the solutions.

## 4 Introduction to Model Reduction

*This lecture will be on the fundamental motivations and mathematical
notions of model reduction in general and for LTI in particular. This lecture
will provide some illustrative examples for the use and results of model
reduction.*

## 4 Projection Based Model Reduction

*In this lecture, I will introduce the fundamental model reduction approach
that uses projections and explain several ways to compute these projections.*

 * Projections and projectors
 * Projection and Interpolation
 * Modal Truncation

## 5 Balanced Truncation

*A mathematical well understood projection method is Balanced Truncation (BT),
which will be introduced in the 5th lecture.*

 * Gramians
 * Balanced Realizations
 * Balanced Truncation

## 6 Mathematical Basics of Balanced Truncation

1. Screencast with introduction to math basics and explanations of the 3rd exercise
sheet on
  * Gramians of LTI systems,
  * Transformations, Invariants, and
  * Balancing of the Gramians.
2. Please download and solve the [3rd exercise sheet](exiii.pdf).
3. Screencast with the solutions.

## 7 Balanced Truncation

In lecture 7, we will learn about Balanced Truncation which is a powerful model
reduction technique for stable LTI systems.

Also, we will address the approach of LQG-BT which combines
controller design and model reduction by Balanced Truncation.

## Lesson 8

In the last lecture, I will showcase how the methods of *Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition* (POD) and *Dynamical Mode Decomposition* (DMD) work for the 2D
*Burgers equation*.

Finally, we will wrap up the contents of the course.
